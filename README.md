<h5>Tales of Symphonia "Fix"</h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(I cannot shake this silly name in my projects, sorry ;))_

This project serves the same purpose as Tales of Zestiria "Fix" did; solve a couple of crash bugs and Namco's framerate limiter. I do not expect it will take off like TZFix did because working with the problems VMProtect creates is enough of a headache to make me think twice about most things.

I no longer think of Namco as a charity case; they did not learn anything from the release of Tales of Zetiria and I will not be there for them if/when they screw up Tales of Berseria.

Given that I am no longer doing this as a service to Namco for coming over to the PC, I am willing to accept donations for my work on this or retroactively for my work on Tales of Zestiria Fix.
